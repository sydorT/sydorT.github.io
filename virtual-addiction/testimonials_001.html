          <div class="section__subtitle">For more than 30 years, Dr. David Greenfield has helped hundreds of individuals and couples overcome their Internet or technology addiction, recover balance and reconnect with the beauty and joy of life. Here is what some of Dr. Greenfield’s patients have to say about him.</div>

                  <div class="blog__title">“Dr. Greenfield gave us the hope we needed”</div>
                  <p>About 10 years ago, our son had developed a gaming addiction while he was in college.  When he returned home during his Junior year, he was a shell of the person he once was.  He had lost 30 pounds and looked like he hadn’t slept in weeks.  He had also spent so much time gaming that he had flunked out of school.  We encouraged him to get therapy.  He saw a couple of therapists but nothing seemed to work until he was treated by Dr. David Greenfield.  After several sessions, our son started to develop other interests and gave permission for my husband and I to speak with Dr. Greenfield.  Dr. Greenfield gave us the hope we needed.  He told us that our son was very smart and would be successful when he was closer to 30.  He told us that something would happen, most likely by accident and he would get the break he needed.  He also told us that he would never be overly social and that he would never care about money.  About 3 years after Dr. Greenfield made these predictions, our son got a lucky break with a job that worked into another job and today he is a very successful software developer and although he does not initiate social relationships, he is engaged to a lovely woman.  And Dr. Greenfield’s statement  about how our son feels about money and material things couldn’t have been more accurate. I would highly recommend Dr. Greenfield to anyone who has an Internet addiction.</p><span>(Janet Tanner, Parent of Patient)</span>
